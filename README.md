# Project Description

Welcome to the Transportation Application using Classical Transportation Methods! This project is an implementation of a web application using Streamlit to solve transportation problems using several well-known methods such as Northwest Corner (NWC), Vogel's Approximation Method (VAM), Modified Distribution (MODI), and Russell's Approximation.

## About the Application

This application is built with the aim of providing an efficient and user-friendly solution to address transportation planning problems. Through a simple web interface, users can:

- Input transportation cost data from different sources to destinations.
- Choose the desired method (NWC, VAM, MODI, or Russell's Approximation) to calculate the optimum solution.
- View the calculation results in the form of tables and intuitive visualizations.

By using this application, it is hoped that users can quickly and effectively find optimal solutions to the transportation problems they face.

## How to Use

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare transportation cost data from sources to destinations in the appropriate format.
2. **Access the Application**: Open the application through a web browser by accessing the provided URL.
3. **Input Data**: Input transportation cost data into the available form.
4. **Choose Method**: Choose the desired method from the available options.
5. **Calculate Solution**: Click the "Calculate" button to obtain the optimum solution.
6. **View Results**: View the calculation results displayed in tables and visualizations.
